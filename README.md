# Django REST Framework vs FastAPI — API Forge

An IMAD / third-year BTech ICA prototype comparing equivalent product APIs through one React + Vite interface. The supplied `api_forge.html` is the frontend design reference: its API Architects header, centered “Backend Showdown” hero and framework toggle, live endpoint catalog, side-by-side code examples, benchmark and validation cards, research notes, and documentation panel are now implemented as the working React page. React owns the interactions so the product catalog, CRUD, backend switch, import, measurements, and test results use the real project APIs and reports. Hard-coded sample benchmark claims and misleading async labels from the static reference were replaced with measured report values and an accurate description of the synchronous implementation.

## Project brief and people

**Objective:** implement the same product catalog workflow in Django REST Framework (DRF) and FastAPI, then compare validation, persistence, documentation, code size and measured local HTTP behavior.

**Project team and work allocation:** the team divided the implementation into backend and frontend work streams. The branches below are prepared for each contributor to continue that work.

| Member | Work stream | Assigned work |
|---|---|---|
| dev | Backend | FastAPI routes and schemas, shared API contract, health behavior, and benchmark coordination. |
| Nimitt | Backend | Django REST Framework models, serializers, API views, import parity, and backend contract testing. |
| Parth | Frontend | React/Vite product catalog, backend selection, and CRUD integration. |
| Krupa | Frontend | API Testing Lab, comparison presentation, loading/error states, and frontend integration. |

The branch names are `dev/backend`, `nimitt/backend`, `parth/frontend`, and `krupa/frontend`. They are pushed as starting branches from the complete project snapshot. Individual contributors should make their own commits on their assigned branch using their GitHub account; the initial repository commit records the project snapshot and is not a claim about who originally wrote each file.

## Architecture and data flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  UI[React + Vite UI<br/>Catalog · Comparison · Testing Lab]
  UI <-->|REST / JSON| FA[FastAPI service]
  UI <-->|REST / JSON| DRF[Django REST Framework service]
  FA --> DB1[(FastAPI SQLite catalog)]
  DRF --> DB2[(DRF SQLite catalog)]
  DJ[DummyJSON products API] -->|explicit import; validated and cached| FA
  DJ -->|explicit import; validated and cached| DRF
```

The two SQLite files are separate by design: each framework owns its local records, IDs and CRUD changes. Switching the backend switches the catalog being read. DummyJSON is an external sample source; import copies supported fields into the selected local database. CRUD, tests and benchmarks do not require DummyJSON availability. Successful upstream responses are cached in memory for five minutes to reduce repeat requests. An upstream timeout, HTTP error or malformed response returns 502 without partially importing rows.

## Requirements and local setup

Use Python 3.11+ and Node 20.19+ (or a newer compatible Node release). Install the three services independently. Open three terminals from this project directory.

### FastAPI

```powershell
cd backend/fastapi_app
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

macOS/Linux activation: `source .venv/bin/activate`. Docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs` and `/redoc`.

### Django REST Framework

```powershell
cd backend/drf_app
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver 8001
```

macOS/Linux activation: `source .venv/bin/activate`. Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8001/api/schema/swagger-ui/`; OpenAPI schema: `/api/schema/`.

### React + Vite

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite (normally `http://localhost:5173`). Optional browser origins are in `frontend/.env.example`; copy it to `frontend/.env` and adjust `VITE_FASTAPI_URL` or `VITE_DRF_URL`. These values are public browser configuration, never secrets. The defaults target local development.

For Django environment settings, copy root `.env.example` to `.env` and set `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`, `DJANGO_DEBUG=False` and `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` appropriately outside local development. Never commit real secrets. `FASTAPI_DB_PATH` and `DRF_DB_PATH` can point to alternate SQLite files. By default each backend writes its own database beside its source; those files are ignored by Git.

## API contract

All endpoints use `/api/v1` and JSON. Successful object responses use `{ "data": ... }`; product lists also return `{ "meta": {"total", "limit", "offset"} }`.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health` | Database-backed health check |
| GET | `/products?q=&limit=20&offset=0` | Search and paginate a backend's local catalog |
| POST | `/products` | Create product (201) |
| GET | `/products/{id}` | Retrieve one product |
| PUT | `/products/{id}` | Replace product fields |
| PATCH | `/products/{id}` | Update supplied fields only |
| DELETE | `/products/{id}` | Delete product |
| POST | `/products/import-dummyjson` | Fetch, validate and import source products |
| POST | `/validation/example` | Serializer/Pydantic example without persistence |

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Desk lamp","description":"Warm LED","price":24.99,"category":"Home","stock":8,"image":"https://example.com/lamp.png"}'
curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/products?limit=20
```

Product rules are matched: title is a trimmed string with 2–120 characters; description is an optional string up to 500 characters; price is a finite number at least 0.01; category is a trimmed nonempty string up to 80 characters; stock is an integer at least zero; image is empty or a valid HTTP(S) URL up to 500 characters. Unknown input fields and explicit nulls are rejected. Missing required create/replace fields fail. PATCH accepts only supplied product fields; empty PATCH is consistently 422. Missing product IDs return 404. Both APIs use 422 validation status and a `detail` list with field locations, but exact wording and root-error locations can reflect DRF versus Pydantic conventions.

DummyJSON import returns `fetched`, `created`, `skipped`, `existing`, `cache_hit`, and `source`. `created` counts records actually inserted; `skipped`/`existing` count fetched records already represented by title/category. A repeated successful import therefore reports zero new creations. No external ID is used as a local database ID. Official source API reference: [DummyJSON Products](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products).

## Tests and verification

Run the complete test and build sequence from the project root:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python scripts/run_checks.py
```

The script runs FastAPI pytest tests plus cross-framework contract tests, Django's test suite, and the frontend production build. A factual summary is saved to `quality-results/latest.json`; reproducible source-size counts are saved to `quality-results/loc.json`. The contract test provisions isolated test SQLite data and compares equivalent create, PATCH, list, retrieve, error-status, field-set and health behavior. Import tests mock DummyJSON; they do not load-test the public service.

The comparison UI has a manual **Run validation example** control and the API Testing Lab checks valid payload, missing title, price below minimum, negative stock, invalid image URL, unexpected field, empty PATCH, wrong types, valid PATCH and missing product against both services. It displays actual status, measured client latency and JSON. Network-offline outcomes are explicit. Successful lab creates are deleted; PATCH checks preserve the original stock value.

## Benchmark methodology and current measurement

Run the reproducible benchmark from the project root:

```bash
python scripts/benchmark.py
```

The default run starts one Uvicorn worker for each application on free loopback ports, prepares separate temporary SQLite files (each seeded with the same three sample products), warms up each route, then runs repeated concurrent requests for health, list (`limit=20`) and retrieval of a seeded product. It records UTC time, Python/platform and dependency versions, server settings, database state, cache/upstream settings, warmups, samples, trial variability, mean, median, P95 and observed throughput. The same runner, seed catalog, request shapes and local network path are used. No DummyJSON request occurs during the benchmark. Latency includes local HTTP and Python client overhead; the small run is illustrative, not a capacity test. Throughput is completed requests divided by trial wall time.

The script writes a fresh report to `benchmark-results/latest.json` and copies it to the frontend's public report path. On this workspace's latest run, measured 2026-10-23 20:21 UTC, Python 3.13.7 / Windows 11, Uvicorn one worker, temporary SQLite with three products, 30 requests per route per trial, 5 warmups, 3 trials, concurrency 4. Each route uses 90 measured samples. Current mean / median / P95 latency and throughput were:

| Route | FastAPI | DRF |
|---|---:|---:|
| Health | 9.162 / 6.230 / 24.717 ms · 397.35 req/s | 20.639 / 20.715 / 26.025 ms · 182.11 req/s |
| Product list | 11.421 / 7.459 / 30.247 ms · 310.99 req/s | 34.117 / 32.895 / 50.319 ms · 114.07 req/s |
| Product retrieve | 9.037 / 7.348 / 21.853 ms · 371.75 req/s | 28.289 / 27.084 / 41.640 ms · 136.22 req/s |

The local run is not evidence that one framework is universally faster; it reflects one setup, tiny seeded data and short trials. The full per-trial variation is in JSON. Future runs replace `latest.json`; archive wanted reports separately.

Historical health-only values from the earlier supplied run are preserved separately in `benchmark-results/historical-health.json`: FastAPI mean 18.498 ms, median 17.606 ms, P95 30.953 ms, 256.94 req/s; DRF mean 23.073 ms, median 22.462 ms, P95 39.833 ms, 201.64 req/s. These are **historical** and are not the current benchmark. An earlier checked-in sample also remains in `benchmark-20261023-231336.json` and is historical.

## Code-size method

Run `python scripts/count_loc.py` (also run by `run_checks.py`). It counts nonblank physical source lines and omits standalone comment lines. Total application LOC includes FastAPI application code, DRF product implementation and the shared frontend. Framework-specific counts are broken out; FastAPI's single module includes app setup and routes, while DRF's count includes product model, serializer, view and exception code. Django settings/project boilerplate and scripts, generated migrations, and tests are reported separately. Dependencies, generated frontend bundles, databases, caches and README are excluded. In this checkout the latest total is **1,907 application LOC**: **237 FastAPI feature LOC**, **225 DRF feature LOC**, 257 configuration/script LOC, 42 migration LOC and 150 test LOC (latter three categories reported separately). The frontend accounts for 1,445 LOC across its entry HTML, React components and styles. Physical LOC depends on formatting and does not measure complexity, correctness or maintainability. The generated `quality-results/loc.json` has per-file values. Do not infer that DRF is twice as verbose from this small prototype.

## Research notes

### Serializers vs Pydantic

DRF serializers validate and convert request values to model-ready data; `ModelSerializer` can derive fields from Django models. FastAPI request models use Pydantic annotations and constraints, and its validation integrates with generated OpenAPI. Both backends enforce the same product rules and return matching status/envelope contracts; framework-specific details and messages may differ. The DRF serializer also rejects undeclared fields explicitly so inputs cannot silently diverge from FastAPI's `extra="forbid"`. References: [DRF serializers](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/), [DRF fields](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/fields/), [FastAPI request bodies](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/body/).

### Synchronous vs asynchronous execution

The current FastAPI handlers are regular `def` functions. They use synchronous SQLite calls, and the DummyJSON importer uses synchronous `httpx.get`; DRF's views/ORM are also synchronous. This is an intentionally simple like-for-like CRUD prototype, not an async-performance demonstration. Async can help when a service spends time waiting on async-compatible I/O and the whole call path is nonblocking; it does not make CPU-bound work faster. Do not infer async behavior from FastAPI's capabilities alone. Reference: [FastAPI async guidance](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/async/).

### Documentation, trade-offs and selection

FastAPI creates OpenAPI from route annotations and Pydantic models and serves Swagger UI at `/docs` plus ReDoc at `/redoc`. DRF uses `drf-spectacular` for its OpenAPI schema and Swagger UI; schema declarations should be checked against actual behavior. DRF fits projects that benefit from Django's integrated ORM, admin, permissions and established conventions. FastAPI fits API-first services that value typed request models and straightforward OpenAPI generation, and can support async I/O when the chosen dependencies do. Team experience, integrations, operational needs and representative benchmarks matter more than a universal ranking. Benchmark results here cover one tiny local workload only.

### Conclusion from this prototype

In the latest measured local run, FastAPI had lower mean latency and higher observed throughput for all three tested routes; the DRF list route had a wider P95 (50.319 ms versus 30.247 ms). This result is specific to the installed versions, one Uvicorn worker, local loopback, a three-record SQLite catalog and short trials. The framework-specific LOC buckets were close (237 FastAPI versus 225 DRF), with different counting boundaries because FastAPI's app and routes share one file. Validation tests show matching status behavior for the covered scenarios; DRF and Pydantic still express error locations/messages differently. Both generate interactive API documentation, through FastAPI's OpenAPI support and DRF's `drf-spectacular`. Maintainability depends on the team's familiarity and project structure: DRF separates models, serializers and views, while this compact FastAPI prototype keeps routes and schemas in one module. This evidence does not establish a universal winner.

### Limitations

- SQLite and three seed products are appropriate for a classroom demo, not a production concurrency or scaling claim.
- In-memory upstream cache is process-local and expires after five minutes; it is not shared across workers or restarts.
- DummyJSON is public and external; imports require network access. No fixed upstream rate limit is assumed; the cache and modest page size reduce unnecessary repeat requests.
- Local benchmark values vary by hardware, background activity, dependency versions and server configuration.
- Contributor branches are prepared for the four work streams; individual contributors should authenticate with their own GitHub accounts before recording personal commits.
